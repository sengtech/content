# Microsoft SSE Private Access PoC

## Kick-off

- Walkthrough of high-level requirements
- Deciding on stakeholders
- User scenarios in scope
- Agree on timeline

## Scoping

- Running PoC in production or test environment?
- Granular apps or QuickAccess (VPN like)
- Kerberos SSO to AD resources?
- Conditional Access policies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Existing conflicting DirectAccess (DA) or legacy VPN configurations. In particular NRPT-table entries.
